## Description: 
The goal was to recreate some of the functionality of the Wikipedia by having one Markdown(not WikiText) file represent each encyclopedia entry
### Specification:
- **Entry Page**: Visiting `/wiki/TITLE`, where TITLE is the title of an encyclopedia entry, renders a page that displays the contents of that encyclopedia entry
- **Index Page**: User can click on any entry name to be taken directly to that entry page
- **Search**: User can type a query into the search box in the sidebar to search for an encyclopedia entry
- **New Page**: Clicking `Create New Page` in the sidebar takes the user to a page where they can create a new encyclopedia entry
- **Edit Page**: On each entry page, the user is able to click a link to be taken to a page where they can edit that entry’s Markdown content
- **Random Page**: Clicking `Random Page` in the sidebar takes user to a random encyclopedia entry
- **Markdown to HTML Conversion**: On each entry’s page, any Markdown content in the entry file is converted to HTML before being displayed to the user
